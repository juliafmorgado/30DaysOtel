# 30 Days of OpenTelemetry

Welcome! This repository documents my **30-day journey** to learn OpenTelemetry from zero to certification-ready.

This is a **public learning project** designed to help others follow along and build observability skills step-by-step. Feel free to follow along with me!

# Goals of This Project

- Understand **observability fundamentals**  
- Become fluent in **tracing, metrics, logs**  
- Master **OpenTelemetry API & SDK**  
- Build and configure the **OpenTelemetry Collector**  
- Debug real pipelines using **zPages, logging exporter, sampling, memory_limiter**  
- Build a final project with:
  - Full instrumentation  
  - Collector pipeline  
  - Transformations (OTTL)  
  - Jaeger + Prometheus output  
- Pass the [OpenTelemetry Certified Associate (OTCA)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/opentelemetry-certified-associate-otca/) exam
