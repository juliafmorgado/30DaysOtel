# Usage:
# 1. Start Jaeger: docker run -d --name jaeger -p 16686:16686 -p 14250:14250 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
# 2. Start Collector: otelcol --config=debug-exporters.yaml
# 3. Send telemetry from your app to http://localhost:4318
# 4. Watch the console output to see exactly what data is being processed
# 5. Check Jaeger at http://localhost:16686 to see traces

# What you'll see in console:
# - Detailed JSON of every span, metric, and log
# - Timestamps, attributes, and all metadata
# - Perfect for debugging configuration issues!
