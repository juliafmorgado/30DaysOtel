# Day 1 – Starting My 30-Day OTel Journey

Today I'm starting a 30-day journey to learn OpenTelemetry from the ground up and prepare for the [OpenTelemetry Certified Associate (OTCA)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/opentelemetry-certified-associate-otca/) certification.

## Why I'm doing this

I recently started a new role at [Dash0](https://www.dash0.com/), and it felt like the right moment to finally slow down and really learn observability properly. I work closely with OpenTelemetry now, and I have an amazing team around me who really know what they're doing, but many times I feel like I understand just enough to be confused.

I'm also a bit scared of pretending I understand when I don't. I've talked a lot about imposter syndrome, and honestly, the best way I know to fight it is to get my hands dirty, ask questions, and teach others while I learn.

**This is me choosing to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).**


## My 30-Day Plan

This is the roadmap I'll follow for the next 30 days. It's detailed, but I expect it to evolve as I learn more and realize what I don't know yet.

### Week 1 – Observability Fundamentals
- **Day 1:** Introduction to the journey  
- **Day 2:** What is OpenTelemetry?  
- **Day 3:** Traces, metrics, logs (the three signals)  
- **Day 4:** Understanding spans  
- **Day 5:** Semantic conventions  
- **Day 6:** Auto vs manual instrumentation  
- **Day 7:** Week 1 recap + consolidation  

### Week 2 – OpenTelemetry APIs & SDK
- **Day 8:** API vs SDK (architecture and separation of concerns)  
- **Day 9:** Tracing API (nested spans, events, attributes)  
- **Day 10:** Metrics API (counters, gauges, histograms)  
- **Day 11:** Logs API (structured logs and trace correlation)  
- **Day 12:** Context propagation  
- **Day 13:** SDK pipelines (samplers, processors, exporters)  
- **Day 14:** Hands-on instrumentation + Week 2 recap  

### Week 3 – The OpenTelemetry Collector
- **Day 15:** Collector architecture (the big picture)  
- **Day 16:** Receivers (OTLP, Filelog, Prometheus)  
- **Day 17:** Processors (batch, transform, attributes, tail sampling)  
- **Day 18:** Exporters (Jaeger, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo)  
- **Day 19:** Transformations (OTTL deep dive)  
- **Day 20:** Deployment models (agent, gateway, sidecar, DaemonSet)  
- **Day 21:** Scaling (load balancing, HA, multi-collector architectures)  
- **Day 22:** Week 3 recap  

### Week 4 – Production Patterns & Final Project
- **Day 23:** Debugging the Collector (logging exporter, zPages)  
- **Day 24:** Debugging traces (propagation failures, message queues)  
- **Day 25:** Backpressure, dropped spans, error handling  
- **Day 26:** Schema management (semantic convention versions)  
- **Day 27:** Advanced patterns + architecture review  
- **Day 28:** **Final project** (app + Collector + transformations + exporters)  
- **Day 29:** Week 4 recap + lessons learned  
- **Day 30:** Mock OTCA exam + final review + next steps  

## What I’ll Share Each Day

Every day, I'll share at least one thing I learned:

- A concept I understood better (or finally understood at all)
- A question I still have
- A mistake I made (and what I learned from it)
- A diagram or mental model
- A short explanation in my own words

**Not everything needs to be perfect or complete.** The goal is consistency and honesty, mostly with myself. If you see something wrong or have suggestions, please feel free to open a PR or message me!

## The Rules I'm Setting for Myself

1. **Ship every day**, even if it's messy
2. **Ask questions** when I'm confused
3. **Teach what I learn** (the best way to solidify understanding)
4. **Be honest** about what I don't know
5. **Have fun** (this is a learning journey, not a performance)
