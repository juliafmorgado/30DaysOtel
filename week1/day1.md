# Day 1 – Starting My 30-Day OTel Journey

Today I start a 30-day journey to learn OpenTelemetry and prepare for the [OTCA](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/opentelemetry-certified-associate-otca/) certification.

I recently started a new job at [Dash0](https://www.dash0.com/) and it felt like the right moment to finally slow down and really learn observability properly. I work close to OpenTelemetry now, I have an amazing team around me that really knows what they’re doing, but many times I feel like I understand just enough to be confused.

I’m also a bit scared of pretending I understand when I don’t. I’ve talked a lot about imposter syndrome, and honestly the best way I know to fight it is to get my hands dirty, ask questions and teach others while I learn.

This is me choosing to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).


## My 30-Day Schedule

This is the plan I’ll follow for the next 30 days. It’s detailed, but expect it to change as I learn more and realize what I don’t know yet.

### Week 1 – Foundations
- **Day 1:** Intro to the journey  
- **Day 2:** What is observability?  
- **Day 3:** Traces, metrics, logs  
- **Day 4:** Understanding spans  
- **Day 5:** Semantic conventions  
- **Day 6:** Auto vs manual instrumentation  
- **Day 7:** Week 1 recap  

### Week 2 – APIs and SDKs
- **Day 8:** API vs SDK (difference and architecture)  
- **Day 9:** Tracing API (nested spans, events, attributes)  
- **Day 10:** Metrics API (counters, gauges, histograms)  
- **Day 11:** Logs API (structured logs and trace correlation)  
- **Day 12:** Context propagation  
- **Day 13:** SDK pipelines (samplers, processors, exporters)  
- **Day 14:** Week 2 recap  

### Week 3 – The Collector
- **Day 15:** Collector architecture (the big picture)  
- **Day 16:** Receivers (OTLP, filelog, Prometheus)  
- **Day 17:** Processors (batch, transform, attributes)  
- **Day 18:** Exporters (Jaeger, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo)  
- **Day 19:** Transformations (OTTL deep dive)  
- **Day 20:** Deployment models (agent, gateway, sidecar, DaemonSet)  
- **Day 21:** Scaling (load balancing, HA, multi-collector)  
- **Day 22:** Week 3 recap  

### Week 4 – Debugging, Architecture, and Review
- **Day 23:** Debugging the collector (logging exporter, zPages)  
- **Day 24:** Debugging traces (propagation failures)  
- **Day 25:** Backpressure, dropped spans, error handling  
- **Day 26:** Schema management (semantic convention versions)  
- **Day 27:** Build the full architecture diagram  
- **Day 28:** Final project (app + collector + transformations + exporters)  
- **Day 29:** Week 4 recap  
- **Day 30:** Mock exam, review, final recap, and architecture  

## What I’ll Share Each Day

Every day, I’ll try share at least one small thing:

- A concept I understood better
- A question I still have
- A mistake I made
- A diagram or mental model
- A short explanation in my own words

Not everything needs to be correct or complete. The goal is consistency and honesty, mostly with myself. If you see something wrong, please feel free to open a PR or message me!

This is Day 1.  
I don’t feel ready, but I’m starting anyway.

If you’re also learning OpenTelemetry, or just curious about observability, come and join me!
